// 2. Declare JavaScript Variables

var myName;

// 3. Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

var a;
a = 5;

// 4. Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another

// Setup
var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b=a;
// Only change code below this line

// 5. Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

var a = 9;

// 6. Declare String Variables

var myFirstName = "Hanna";
var myLastName = "Berazouskaya";

// 7. Understanding Uninitialized Variables

// Only change code below this line
var a=5;
var b=10;
var c="I am a";
// Only change code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

// 8. Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

// 9. Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords

// Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.

let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";

// 10. Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword

 /* Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices. Do not change the strings assigned to the variables. */

 const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
 let fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
 fact = "is awesome!";
 console.log(FCC, fact); // Change this line

 // 11. Add Two Numbers with JavaScript

 /* Example:

const myVar = 5 + 10;
myVar now has the value 15.

Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.*/

const sum = 10 + 10;

// 12. Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

/* Example

const myVar = 12 - 6;
myVar would have the value 6.

Change the 0 so the difference is 12. */

const difference = 45 - 33;

// 13. Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript

/* Example

const myVar = 13 * 13;
myVar would have the value 169.

Change the 0 so that product will equal 80. */

const product = 8 * 10;

// 14. Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript

/* Example

const myVar = 16 / 2;
myVar now has the value 8. 

Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2. */

const quotient = 66 / 33;

// 15. Increment a Number with JavaScript

/* You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar. */

//let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;

// 16. Decrement a Number with JavaScript

/* You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.
i--;
is the equivalent of i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar. */

let myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;

// 17. Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript

/* Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7). */

const ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line

var myDecimal = 5.7;

// 18. Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript

/* Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0. */

// const product = 2.0 * 2.5;

// 19. Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript

/* Now let's divide one decimal by another.

Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2. */

//const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // Change this line

// 20. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

/* Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator. */

const remainder = 11%3;

// 21. Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

/* Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator. */

let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;

// 22. Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

/* Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator. */

let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;

// 23. Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

/* Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator. */

let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;

// 24. Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

/* Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator. */

let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;

// 24. Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

/* Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes". */

//const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line

// 25. Quoting Strings with Single Quotes

/* Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.

Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters. */

const myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank"> Link </a>';
