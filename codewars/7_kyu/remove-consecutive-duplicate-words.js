/* DESCRIPTION:
Your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate words from a string, leaving only first words entries. For example:

"alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta"

--> "alpha beta gamma delta alpha beta gamma delta"
Words will be separated by a single space. There will be no leading or trailing spaces in the string. An empty string (0 words) is a valid input.

// Option 1

const removeConsecutiveDuplicates = s => s.split(" ").filter((x,i,arr) => x!=arr[i-1]).join(" ");
